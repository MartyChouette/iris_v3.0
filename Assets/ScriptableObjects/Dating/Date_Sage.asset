  characterName: Sage
  adText: Single. Intuitive. Self-employed. I can sense you are reading this right
    now. You have been through a lot lately (haven't we all), and you sometimes overthink
    at night. There is a name that starts with a letter, and it still affects you.
    I'm feeling an upcoming change - possibly travel, possibly a haircut.

    commentary: First date comes with a spontaneous reading (donation suggested).
  - keyword: upcoming change
    commentary: They'll land one eerie, specific truth about you - and accidentally
      drop a piece of your lore.
  - keyword: a letter
    commentary: Warm, attentive, and weirdly good at making people feel seen. May
      offer... substances.
