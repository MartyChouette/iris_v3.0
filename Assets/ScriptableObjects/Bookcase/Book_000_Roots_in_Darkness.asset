  title: Roots in Darkness
  author: Eleanor Moss
  pageTexts:
  - The roots do not ask permission. They push through clay and stone, searching
    for what they need in total darkness.
  - I have often wondered if the flower knows it is beautiful, or if beauty is simply
    a side effect of reaching toward light.
  - "When the last petal falls, the stem stands bare \u2014 not empty, but unburdened."
