  title: Still Life with Vase
  author: Olive Stillman
  pageTexts:
  - 'The vase held three stems: one straight, one curved, one broken. Together they
    made a sentence.'
  - 'Still life painters know: the flower in the painting will outlast the flower
    on the table.'
  - She arranged the flowers not for beauty but for conversation. The lily had something
    to say to the rose.
