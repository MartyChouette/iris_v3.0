  - "To press a flower is to stop time \u2014 or at least, to press pause. The color
    fades, but the shape remembers."
  - 'Page 47 of her journal: a flattened daisy, brown at the edges, still holding
    its circular argument.'
  - Some flowers are better preserved in memory than in books. But we press them
    anyway.
