  title: Bloom & Fade
  author: Basil Harrow
  pageTexts:
  - The bloom arrives without announcement. One morning the bud is closed; the next,
    it has made its decision.
  - Fading is the bloom's longest act. We celebrate the opening, but the slow close
    deserves its own ovation.
  - Between bloom and fade there is a single perfect day. The flower does not know
    which one it is.
