  title: Chlorophyll Dreams
  author: Silas Compost
  pageTexts:
  - Chlorophyll is the green dream of sunlight made solid. Every leaf is a sleeping
    solar panel.
  - The plant does not choose to photosynthesize. It simply faces the light and lets
    chemistry do the rest.
  - At night, the chloroplasts rest. Even the most dedicated workers need darkness
    to make sense of the day.
