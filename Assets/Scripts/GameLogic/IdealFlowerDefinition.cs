     * @details
     * Intent:
     * - Scriptable authoring definition of "ideal" trimming outcomes:
     *   stem length, cut angle, and per-part rules.
     *
     * Rule types:
     * - Stem: idealStemLength + deltas define perfect vs. hard fail ranges.
     * - Cut Angle: idealCutAngleDeg + deltas define perfect vs. hard fail ranges.
     * - Weights: stemScoreWeight / cutAngleScoreWeight determine contribution to final normalized score.
     *
     * Game-over toggles:
     * - stemCanCauseGameOver / cutAngleCanCauseGameOver allow authoring "strict ideals."
     * - (Per-part rules extend this strictness to leaves/petals/etc.)
     *
     * Authoring notes:
     * - Treat deltas as "tolerance" knobs. Tightening them over time is a direct mechanical path to
     *   your metric-cruelty escalation without changing core code.
     *
     * Invariants:
     * - Perfect delta should be <= hard-fail delta for each measured dimension.
     

 * Responsibilities:
 * - (Documented) See fields and methods below.
 *
 * Unity lifecycle:
 * - Awake(): cache references / validate setup.
 * - OnEnable()/OnDisable(): hook/unhook events.
 * - Update(): per-frame behavior (if any).
 *
 * Gotchas:
 * - Keep hot paths allocation-free (Update/cuts/spawns).
 * - Prefer event-driven UI updates over per-frame string building.
