/**
 * @file FlowerPartRuntime.cs
 * @brief Runtime component attached to any physical flower piece (leaf, petal, crown, etc).
 *
 * @details
 * FlowerPartRuntime is the *per-part* runtime state + detachment authority for the flower system.
 * It sits on individual mesh pieces that can be cut, ripped, swapped, or physically broken.
 *
 * In the Iris flower loop, parts are not just decorative geometry: they are scored, tracked, and
 * can end the session when critical pieces are lost (most importantly the Crown).
 *
 * This component’s primary job is to answer two questions reliably:
 *  1) "Is this part still attached?" (and if not, why / is it permanent?)
 *  2) "Does this detachment require an immediate fail right now?"
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------
 * Responsibilities
 * ------------------------------------------------------------
 * - Identity: Provide a stable @ref PartId that other systems (e.g., scoring / rules) can match.
 * - Runtime state: Track attachment state (@ref isAttached) and condition (@ref condition).
 * - Detachment authority: Centralize detachment transitions via @ref MarkDetached, including:
 *      - Deduping (no double-fire)
 *      - Recording canonical detach reason (@ref lastDetachReason)
 *      - Enforcing "never rebind" semantics (@ref permanentlyDetached)
 * - Physics event intake:
 *      - React to Unity joint breaks via OnJointBreak().
 *      - React to custom XY tether breaks via OnXYJointBroke().
 * - Failure rules (runtime-level):
 *      - Enforce the one *hard* instant-fail rule: Crown detachment triggers game over.
 *      - Optionally enforce a crown fall failsafe (Y-threshold) after detachment.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------
 * Non-Responsibilities
 * ------------------------------------------------------------
 * - Does not compute score. (This script only exposes metadata/hints like @ref scoreWeight.)
 * - Does not decide "ideal" authoring rules. (Those belong in data definitions such as Ideal rules.)
 * - Does not render UI. (It may log; UI should subscribe to session/brain events.)
 * - Does not perform cutting. (Cutting systems call @ref MarkDetached when a part is separated.)
 * - Does not manage reattachment/rebinding. (A rebinder can read @ref permanentlyDetached
 *   and @ref lastDetachReason, but it should not live here.)
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------
 * Key Data Model
 * ------------------------------------------------------------
 * Identity / classification:
 * - @ref PartId is the stable lookup key used to match authoring rules (e.g., "Leaf_A_03").
 * - @ref kind distinguishes structural roles (Leaf/Petal/Crown/etc).
 *
 * Runtime condition:
 * - @ref condition describes the current health/quality of the part (Normal/Withered/etc).
 *   This is *not* the same as attachment; a part can be withered but still attached.
 *
 * Attachment state (the authoritative trio):
 * - @ref isAttached: true while part is physically considered attached.
 * - @ref permanentlyDetached: once true, this part MUST never be rebound (hard rule).
 * - @ref lastDetachReason: canonical classification of how the detachment happened.
 *
 * Authoring / rule hints:
 * - Fields like @ref contributesToScore, @ref allowedMissing, @ref allowedWithered, and
 *   @ref scoreWeight provide lightweight hints for scoring/rules systems.
 * - @warning These are "hints" and may duplicate rule data elsewhere. If you keep both,
 *   define precedence clearly (data-definition should usually win).
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------
 * Detachment Semantics (Very Important)
 * ------------------------------------------------------------
 * Detachment is a one-way transition unless an *external* rebinder explicitly allows it.
 *
 * The intended contract for production:
 * - All detachment sources call @ref MarkDetached with an explicit @ref DetachReason.
 * - permanent=true means: "this part is irrevocably gone" (rebinder must refuse).
 * - If detachment is suppressed (@ref ShouldSuppressDetachEvents), the call is ignored.
 *
 * Suppression window:
 * - @ref ShouldSuppressDetachEvents reads @c session.suppressDetachEvents.
 * - This exists to prevent accidental joint-break events during cut/rebind grace windows
 *   from falsely triggering detachment and/or game over.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------
 * Failure Rules (Session-End Triggers)
 * ------------------------------------------------------------
 * This script intentionally keeps instantaneous fail rules minimal:
 * - Crown detachment forces game over. This can be detected by:
 *     - @ref kind == FlowerPartKind.Crown, OR
 *     - GameObject layer == "CrownCore" (if present in the project).
 *
 * Optional crown fall failsafe:
 * - If @ref enableCrownYFailsafe is true, a Crown part that falls below @ref crownFailY
 *   triggers @c session.ForceGameOver("Crown fell too low.").
 * - @note The Y-failsafe checks @c !isAttached so it only fires after the crown has detached.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------
 * Unity Lifecycle Notes
 * ------------------------------------------------------------
 * - Awake():
 *   - Auto-wires @ref session and @ref brain from parents if not set.
 *   - Auto-wires @ref xyJoint and caches Unity @ref unityJoints if not provided.
 *   - Subscribes to @c xyJoint.onBroke (UnityEvent) to detect tether breaks.
 * - OnDestroy():
 *   - Unsubscribes from @c xyJoint.onBroke to prevent leaked listeners during cutter destroys.
 * - Update():
 *   - Runs the crown Y-failsafe check (if enabled).
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------
 * Performance & Allocation Notes
 * ------------------------------------------------------------
 * Hot paths to keep allocation-free:
 * - Joint break callbacks (OnJointBreak / OnXYJointBroke)
 * - Detachment processing (@ref MarkDetached)
 *
 * Current per-frame work:
 * - Update() performs a small conditional check; acceptable for a small number of parts.
 *   If many parts exist simultaneously, consider moving the crown fall failsafe to:
 *   - a coroutine that runs only after detachment, or
 *   - a session-level monitor that watches the crown instance only.
 *
 * Logging:
 * - Debug.Log in @ref MarkDetached is useful for development but can spam.
 *   Consider gating logs behind a session/debug flag for production builds.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------
 * Integration Points
 * ------------------------------------------------------------
 * - FlowerSessionController:
 *   - Provides suppression window (@c suppressDetachEvents).
 *   - Receives hard fail calls via @c ForceGameOver(string).
 * - FlowerGameBrain:
 *   - Typically evaluates results and scoring; this script only supplies state + identity.
 * - Cutting / swap systems:
 *   - Should call @ref MarkDetached with explicit reasons (PlayerCut/StemSwap/etc).
 * - Rebinding systems (if present):
 *   - Must respect @ref permanentlyDetached and reason-based rules.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------
 * Common Failure Modes / Gotchas
 * ------------------------------------------------------------
 * - Double detachment:
 *   - Without the @ref isAttached guard, multiple physics events could cascade into duplicate
 *     failures/logs. This script prevents that by early-returning if already detached.
 *
 * - Missing layer:
 *   - If "CrownCore" layer does not exist, crown detection falls back to @ref kind.
 *   - Ensure @ref kind is correctly authored for crown pieces.
 *
 * - Cutter destroy race conditions:
 *   - Parts destroyed mid-event can leave listeners dangling; OnDestroy handles this.
 *
 * - Rebind loopholes:
 *   - If a rebinder ignores @ref permanentlyDetached, you will get inconsistent scoring and
 *     narrative states. Treat permanence as a hard authority rule.
